    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>French fries (North American English), chips (British English), finger
      chips (Indian English), french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet
      or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating from either Belgium or
      France. They are prepared by cutting the potato into even strips, then
      drying and frying it, usually in a deep fryer. Most french fries are
      produced from frozen russet potatoes.</p>
    <p>French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally
      eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they
      commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and
      bars. They are often salted and may be served with ketchup, vinegar,
      mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialities.</p>
